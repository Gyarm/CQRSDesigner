Serializers
===========

The code will generate serializers for each of the event classes in separate classes so that 
they can easily be swapped out if, for instance, you want to apply encryption while writing
some event data.

The event version number is also part of the serialiser class name as different versions may
have different properties.

This uses the serialisation/deserialisation attributes to control the serialisation process:

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.ondeserializedattribute(v=vs.110).aspx

The code generation also creates two static methods for serialising from binary or from name/value pairs.
These require a class that inheriots from EventSerializer(Of TEvent As {New, IEvent})
